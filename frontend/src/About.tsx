          It&apos;s called "Tenant First Aid" because it&apos;s like emergency
          help for renters facing eviction—quick, clear, and focused on what to
          do right now. Just like medical first aid helps stabilize someone
          before they can see a doctor, Tenant First Aid gives Oregon tenants
          the essential legal info they need to understand an eviction notice,
          respond on time, and avoid mistakes that could cost them their home.
