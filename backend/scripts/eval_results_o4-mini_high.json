Nothing changes until you get a WRITTEN notice.  \n   \u2022 Because your first-year anniversary is June 1, the landlord would have to hand-deliver or mail a written \u201cno-renewal/30-day termination\u201d notice no later than May 1 for it to be valid.  \n   \u2022 A phone outburst is legally meaningless.\n\n2. If no timely written notice arrives, the lease simply turns into a month-to-month on June 1 with all the same terms except duration and any lawful rent increase.  \n   \u2022 After you pass the one-year mark, the landlord cannot end the tenancy without cause unless they have one of the four \u201cqualifying landlord reasons\u201d (sale to an owner-occupant, the landlord or family moving in, major repairs, or demolition/convert to non-residential) AND give you 90-days\u2019 written notice plus one month\u2019s rent relocation payment.  ORS 90.427(3)(c)(B), (5)\u2013(6).\n\n3. Retaliation defense.  You complained about an illegal rent hike (ORS 90.323/324).  If the landlord serves a termination notice because of that, you can claim retaliation under ORS 90.385.  Keep records of when you objected and the phone call.\n\n4. Rent cap.  Even on month-to-month, any 2024 increase must be no more than 8.8 % above your current rent and needs 90 days\u2019 written notice (ORS 90.323-324).\n\n5. What to do now.  \n   \u2022 Wait and see if a proper written notice arrives.  \n   \u2022 If it does, check the date and reason.  If it\u2019s late, missing, or retaliatory, you can ignore it or defend if the landlord later files an eviction.  \n   \u2022 If you receive any notice and are unsure, talk to a local tenants\u2019 clinic or a lawyer right away.",

A vague \u201cyou\u2019ll regret it\u201d may fall short, especially if there was no physical move toward the worker, no weapon and no witness other than the worker.\n\nWhat to do now\n\n\u2022 Watch the mail; keep the envelope.  \n\u2022 Gather your boyfriend\u2019s statement, any witnesses, texts, video, etc.  \n\u2022 Stay current on rent (and don\u2019t let the landlord accept rent dated after the termination time).  \n\u2022 If you\u2019re sued (you\u2019ll receive a court summons), appear and raise: improper service and lack of a serious threat.  \n\u2022 Offer, in writing, to bar your boyfriend from further contact with staff; sometimes landlords rescind when risk is removed.\n\nNeed a lawyer?

Right to cure by removing the cat  \n   \u2022 Even when there has been repeat damage, you may stop the eviction simply by permanently removing the cat from the premises before tomorrow at 4 p.m.  ORS 90.396(2).  \n   \u2022 The statute does not require advance payment for repairs, only removal of the animal.\n\n3. Paying for repairs  \n   \u2022 You remain liable for all proven repair costs (90.401), but offering to pay does not guarantee the landlord must withdraw the notice.  \n   \u2022 Still, put any offer to pay in writing\u2014some landlords will rescind the notice or sign a written settlement if they know the damage will be fixed and the pet is gone.\n\n4. If the landlord files an eviction case (FED)  \n   \u2022 Raise these defenses: (a) notice is defective (if it omitted facts or the cure language), (b) you removed the pet before the deadline, (c) you offered reasonable payment for damages.  \n   \u2022 Bring proof: vet records or photos showing the cat is gone, your written offer to pay, etc.\n\n5. Practical next steps \u2013 act fast  \n   \u2022 Move the cat out today and give the landlord dated written confirmation (\u201cCat removed permanently as of ___\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Ask in writing for an itemized repair bill and offer a payment plan.  \n   \u2022 Keep a copy of everything you give the landlord.  \n   \u2022 If the landlord sues anyway, take your papers to court and state the defenses above.\n\nIf the notice is clearly defective or the landlord refuses to accept cure, you can ask the court to dismiss the case and you may seek your attorney fees under ORS 90.255.",

Wrong statute?  \n   \u2022 ORS 90.396 (1)(f)(C) only applies if you made a \u201ccannabinoid extract\u201d as that term is defined in ORS 475C.009.  \n   \u2022 An \u201cextract\u201d is made with hydro-carbon, CO\u2082 or other highly volatile solvents.  A simple soak in food-grade ethanol (tincture) is normally classified as a \u201ccannabinoid concentrate/tincture,\u201d which state law lets adults make at home (ORS 475C.257).  \n   \u21d2 If you used plain drinking alcohol and no pressurized or hydro-carbon process, argue in court that the notice cites the wrong statutory basis, so the 24-hour termination is void.\n\n2. Defective notice?  \n   \u2022 ORS 90.396 requires the notice to state specific facts (dates, what you did, why it qualifies as an illegal extract) and give at least 24 hours before the stated termination time.  \n   \u2022 If the notice is vague (\u201cmanufacture of extract \u2013 neighbors smelled weed\u201d) or was served incorrectly (see ORS 90.150 & 90.155), it is invalid.\n\n3. No right to cure only if 90.396 really applies.  \n   \u2022 If the activity is only a minor lease violation (odor, minor drug rule breach), landlord must use a 30-day for-cause notice under ORS 90.392, which gives you at least 14 days to fix the problem.  Jumping straight to 24 hours is an overstep.\n\nNext steps fast:\n\u2022 Keep paying rent.  Accepting rent after a bad notice often waives the notice (ORS 90.412).  \n\u2022 Photograph the notice, envelope and your equipment (show plain ethanol, no risky setup).  \n\u2022 Take everything flammable/solvent out of the unit now\u2014so the judge sees no ongoing problem.  \n\u2022 Go to the FED (eviction) first appearance and tell the clerk you will raise a \u201cdefective notice\u201d defense.  Bring the statutes above and any proof of your method.\n\nIf the landlord re-issues a proper 30-day notice later, you still gain time and the right to cure.\n\nNeed more help?
